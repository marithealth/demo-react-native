# Welcome to Marit's Demo React Native App 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

You're working on our mobile app and need to implement an "Invite a Friend" feature. Fortunately, Oscar was able to get your started but he has won the lottery 💰 and is traveling the world for the next year.

We need you to get acclimated with the code base, get it running, and be ready to help Goo out on shipping some new features next week 🚢.

JD (our product manager) is prepping the stories ✅. Thanks!

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
